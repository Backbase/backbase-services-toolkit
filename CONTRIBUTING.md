## Our Standards

Many of our products are widely used in other applications as such we place an emphasis on changes following SEMVER and
not introducing breaking changes. There should always be comprehensive unit tests and end to end tests. We also need to fully document any new features or provide migration guides.

## Our Responsibilities

* Backlog: https://backbase.atlassian.net/browse/BEFOUND search for issues with the
  [ideal-for-contribution](https://backbase.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BEFOUND%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22In%20Analysis%22%2C%20Open%2C%20%22Ready%20for%20Dev%22)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20ideal-for-contribution) tag.


### Bug reports
For bug reports a rule of thumb is to provide as much information as you can including replication steps, expected result, logs etc. Lack of information will slow down the process. In most cases, Service SDK team will verify the bug fix, however on rare occasions the issue reporter could be asked to verify on their capability with Service SDK cr version containing the fix.

### New Feature / Change Request / Improvement with a PR
For new features it is important we understand the motivation for requirements, donâ€™t just create a PR or request without enough information for others to understand a feature. Same applies for the change request or an improvement.
Documentation for the plugin is [here](https://github.com/Backbase/intellij-docs) (published [here](http://engineering.backbase.com/intellij-docs/)) and will need to be updated if there are any changes or new features, either create a documentation PR or send the text to us to integrate in the documentation.
